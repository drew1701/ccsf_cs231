# War, the card game of chance where 26 battles take place between rival
# armies. The higher card wins each battle. Ties accumulate a bonus to
# be won at the next battle. For each battle, output the number of
# cards left, the two cards drawn, and the win totals. If a battle is a
# tie, its value is accrued towards the next battle that is won.

# card. The order of the names list determines the cards' values.
